1.What is Angular?
Angular is a javascript UI binding Framework which helps us to bind View with the Model.
Angular helps us to create SPA using routing concept.
Angular helps us to create MVC,MVVM and MVW architecture in the browser.

2.Differences between AngularJS and Angular?
1.Angular uses Components that loads view , css and Model. 2. Mobile compliant 3. ANgular has CLI. 4. Lazy loading 5. written in Typescript.
1.AngularJS loads view first and then controller is loaded. 2. written in javascript.

3.What are the directives in Angular?
Directives are used to apply behaviour to the HTML DOM.
Directives are the Angular syntaxes in the view.
eg- [(ngModel)] , [hidden] , {{}} , (click)

4.What are the types of directives?
there are 3 types of directives in Angular(SAC)
1.Structural Directives - This directive changes the structure of the DOM eg-ngFor
2.Attribute Directives - This directive does not change the structure but changes behaviour hides eg-ngIf , [hidden]
3.Component Directives - this directive is used to add user defined component in DOM eg-<component tag>

5.what is npm and node_modules?
npm is node package manager which helps us to install any java script libraries or packages.
node_modules is the diectory in which all the packages are installed.

6.what is the use of package.json file?
package.json file lists out all the javascript libraries that we use in the project

7.what is typescript?
TypeScript is a superset of javascript .Typescript is a language that adds types to javascript.typescript compiles and it is converted into javascript.

8.what is angular cli?
angular cli is used to create readymade template for creating angular projects.

9.What is Component and Module?
A Component binds the view with the Model and CSS.
A group of components are grouped to form a module.

10.what is decorator?
A Decorator says to Angular what kind of class is this
eg: @Component , @NgModule

11.what is databinding?
databinding defines how the view communicates with the component. there are 4 types of databinding
1.{{}} -> String interpolation
2.[ ] -> property binding -- data flows from component  to view.
3.() -> event binding -- any events are clicked the data flows from view to component.
4.[(ngModel)] ->two way data binding

12.Architecture or Building blocks of Angular?
1.Template - view or HTML of Angular.
2.Component 
3.Module - Group of components
4.directives - to add behaviour to tht HTML eg-ngFor , [hidden] , <component-directive>
5.bindings - event binding () -> from HTML to Component , Property Binding [] -> from component to view , [(ngModel)] - > Two way binding
6.services - th share common logic among the components.
7.Dependency injection - to inject services via constructor in components.

13.what is SPA?
SPA stands for SIngle Page Application
Single page Application are the applications where the main UI is loaded only once and then the needed UI is loaded on demand.

14.What is Routing?
Routing helps you to define navigation in Angular.
Routing is a collection of url and respective component to be loaded when url id called.
Routing is needed to implement SPA.

 15.How to implement Routing?
 Add Router Collection with url and exact component for that route.
 Add <router-outlet> </router-outlet> in the main component to define navigation.
 Add [routerLink]=['Home']

 16.how to become routing from component? 
 route.navigate(['/Home'])

 17.Lazy Loading in Angular?
 Lazy Loading is acheived using modules
 Divide the project into separate modules and load the children in routes collection by using routeChildren

 18.What are services in Angular?
 Services helps you to share common logic in Angular.

 19.what is dependency injection?
 Dependency Injection is a design pattern in which angular injects classes into component.

 20.Use of dependency injection?
 when changed in one place it will reflect it another places too.

21.difference between ng serve and ng build?
ng serve builds the application in the memory. it is preferred during the development.
ng build builds the application on the disk and creates dist folder and places all the binaries in the dist folder.

22. what is ng build --prod do?
ng build --prod makes production ready applications it does minification and removes all the unnecessary code.
